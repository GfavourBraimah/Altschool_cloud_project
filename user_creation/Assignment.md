This command sets an expiry date of 2 weeks for the user "bog_reaper."




# Step 3: Prompt User to Change Password

After user creation and setting an expiry date, the system prioritizes security. When users log in for the first time, they're guided to change their passwords immediately. This safeguards against default or weak passwords. Password changes on initial login ensure personalized and secure access to the system.

- Open a terminal.
- Run the command: `sudo usermod -a -G altschool bog_reaper`.

- Grant the "altschool" group permission to run the `cat` command on the `/etc/` directory.

- Open a terminal.
- Run the command: `sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/altschool`.
